1.Difference between FIFO and Capacity scheduler:
FIFO Scheduler
The FIFO Scheduler follows first in first out stratedgy i.e, it places the applications in a queue and executes them.
A small file has to wait until the large file preceding it in the queue to execute first which is time inefficient.
	
Capactiy Scheduler
Capacity Scheduler allocates shared cluster resources among users and groups.
The idea is to share the available resources in the Hadoop cluster among multiple organizations 
who collectively fund the cluster based on their needs.
It provides cost effective access to Hadoop clusters for the organizations.


2.Limitations of hadoop 1.x and how they were overcome in hadoop 2.x:
In hadoop1.x only single namenode manages the entire namespace i.e., it has a single point of failure, If the name node 
fails the entire cluster fails.
In hadoop2.x Multiple namenodes manages different portions of the namespace.(HDFS Federation)
Multiple namenodes are present in an active-standby mode.(High Availability)
In case of failure of the active namenode the standby namenode takes care of the cluster.
In hadoop 2.x the number of nodes that can fit into the cluster has been scaled up from 4000 
to 10000.
